/// The Global Descriptor Table (GDT) is a data structure used by Intel
/// x86-family processors starting with the 80286 in order to define the
/// characteristics of the various memory areas used during program execution,
/// including the base address, the size, and access privileges like
/// executability and writability. These memory areas are called segments in
/// Intel terminology.

/// @brief Bitmasks used to access to specific bits of the GDT.
/// @details
/// #### PRIV (Privilege bits)
/// Contains the ring level, specifically:
///   - `00 (0)` = highest (kernel),
///   - `11 (3)` = lowest (user applications).
///
/// #### S (Descriptor type)
/// This bit should be set for code or data segments and should be cleared
/// for system segments (eg. a Task State Segment).
///
/// #### EX (Executable bit)
///   - If 1 code in this segment can be executed, ie. a code selector.
///   - If 0 it is a data selector.
///
/// #### DC (Direction bit/Conforming bit)
/// Direction bit for data selectors: Tells the direction. 0 the segment grows up.
/// 1 the segment grows down, ie., the offset has to be greater than the limit.
///
/// Conforming bit for code selectors:
///  - If 1 code in this segment can be executed from an equal or lower privilege
///    level. For example, code in ring 3 can far-jump to conforming code in a ring 2 segment.
///    The privl-bits represent the highest privilege level that is allowed to execute
///    the segment. For example, code in ring 0 cannot far-jump to a conforming code segment
///    with privl==0x2, while code in ring 2 and 3 can. Note that the privilege level remains
///    the same, ie. a far-jump form ring 3 to a privl==2-segment remains in ring 3
///    after the jump.
///  - If 0 code in this segment can only be executed from the ring set in privl.
///
/// #### RW (Readable bit/Writable bit)
///  - Readable bit for code selectors:
///    - Whether read access for this segment is allowed.
///    - Write access is never allowed for code segments.
///  - Writable bit for data selectors:
///    - Whether write access for this segment is allowed.
///    - Read access is always allowed for data segments.
///
/// #### AC (Accessed bit)
/// Just set to 0. The CPU sets this to 1 when the segment is accessed.
///
/// #### GR (Granularity bit)
///  - If 0 the limit is in 1 B blocks (byte granularity);
///  - if 1 the limit is in 4 KiB blocks (page granularity).
///
/// #### SZ (Size bit)
///  - If 0 the selector defines 16 bit protected mode;
///  - if 1 it defines 32 bit protected mode.
///
///  You can have both 16 bit and 32 bit selectors at once.
///
