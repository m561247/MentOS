/// The IDT is used to show the processor what Interrupt Service Routine
/// (ISR) to call to handle an exception. IDT entries are also called
/// Interrupt requests whenever a device has completed a request and needs to
/// be serviced.
/// ISRs are used to save the current processor state and set up the
/// appropriate segment registers needed for kernel mode before the kernelâ€™s
/// C-level interrupt handler is called. To handle the right exception, the
/// correct entry in the IDT should be pointed to the correct ISR.

 * difference is that for interrupt gates, interrupts are automatically
 * disabled upon entry and reenabled upon IRET which restores the saved EFLAGS.
